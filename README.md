# EDA-Terrorism

The task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset ‘Global Terrorism’. We have to gain insights from the data using exploratory data analysis and note down our observations, find out the hot zone of terrorism and other key factors, like top countries, cities, weapons used, etc. The code is written in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and the libraries used are: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and seaborn for better visualization.

The data can be found at https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5. The csv could not be uploaded because of size constraints. 

This is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation: Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Ananlytics domain.
